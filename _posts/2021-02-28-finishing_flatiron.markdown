What a journey this has been! 

It has been so hard to get this far--and I'm so proud of the journey. When I originally set out to complete this program in August 2018, I hoped to finish in a year. Needless to say...that didn't happen. 

I got 4 of the 5 projects done in that year while working--which I'm so proud of. But after that I snagged a job as a data analytics developer and welcomed a new child into our family--life got a little crazy, and finishing the final project got put further and further down on my to-do list, especially as I got to work using Python and R at work.

I've spent my weekends and free hours during the quarentine working my way back through the Javascript and React components of the instruction. The Javascript section was entirely reworked. I found the rework much better and easier to understand, and I'm really proud of my renewed mastery of Javascript. 

I'm also really proud of my final project and my understanding of React/Redux. I can't wait to bring my understanding off all these frameworks to my current job, and build out the projects that I'm so proud of from Flatiron into a proper portfolio.
