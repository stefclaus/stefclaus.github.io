I'm really excited to be putting the finishing touches on my javascript project.

First off, I was excited to revisit my rails project--I was really proud of the functionality of my subfinder, and I hoped to revisit the project to add even more bells and whistles.

I really appreciated the opportunity in this project to practice what we've learned with javascript and jquery. It was helpful to remember how to grab elements, and insert them into the DOM. Plus it feels magical to see so many elements appear on the page with no page refresh---!

While my project is meeting the project requirements, there are still a few things I'd like to change.

When I added in my javascript, I had to disable turbolinks and my beautfiul bootstrap navbar. As a part of a second pass, I'd like to make all of things play well together. (I may even do this later this week if I have time.) I also would likely like to add a bit more styling to the whole project. When I got rid of my bootstrap navbar, I also lost the beautiful styling that applied to the rest of the page.

I've been in the program long enough that the versions have moved from v6 to v7. A big part of this update was better curriculum for HMTL and CSS, which I look forward to (re)visiting before I move onto React/Redux.


On to the next!
