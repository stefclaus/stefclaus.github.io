Hello, world. I’m Stef. 

I started coding about a year ago at work. 

It's not that coding was a part of my job, per se. It's just that I had a problem: I was spending tens of hours doing repetitive taks in Excel. I was stiching the same reports together by hand day after day, week after week. Frankly, it was boring, and it sucked.

So I started playing around with the macro recording feature in Excel, and I started poking around at the code that using that ‘record’ feature produced. This really made code click for me--I could see exactly what I knew so well in Excel written out in code format. And I was automating away all my own pain.

After that, I bought a book on VBA (specifically, *VBA For Dummies* in case you were wondering...) and this huge light turned on in my head. VBA was so much more than just recording what I did on my screen in Excel. VBA could make Excel capable of all this insane stuff that's not available from the menus-- looping, if statements, and finding all unique combinations of a set of values--and I could apply that to harder Excel problems.

As my next project, I created a tool that creates massive numbers of Facebook ads in Excel according to my firm's exact specifications. Then I made the tool flexible and usable and customizable. I’ve gotten buy in from a few folks on my team, who have used it to be able to produce rapid-fire tests and save tens of hours.

I loved making these tools. I didn't know what I was doing, I was just hacking away bit by bit using my one reference book and StackOverflow. It was frustrating--sometimes it didn't work--for hours--but when it worked, it was pure magic.

I started Flatiron's Online Full Stack Web Dev course back in August. I've loved (almost) every day of it.
